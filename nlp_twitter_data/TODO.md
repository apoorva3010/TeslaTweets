# Applying NLP on twitter data
Here you will have to use Natural Language Processing techniques to process the datatset. For example, we will use tokenization to split the tweets into words/sentences and remove all the stopwords like "and", "or", "if"... and then use lemmatization to convert words with similar meaning to one word, example studying and studies will become study. After this we can use Word2Vec, Tfidfvectorizer to convert words to a vector. After converting them into a vectors, you can convert the dataframe to csv and save it.
