# Exploratory data analysis on twitter data
Here we can look at the twitter data and try to find insights and add new features to our dataset like:-
- Number of words in the tweet
- Length of the tweet
- Number of sentences in the tweet

# Datasets required
1. [Elon Musk tweets](https://github.com/nowmozillaclub/Power-of-Elon-Musk-s-tweets/blob/master/datasets/data_elonmusk.csv)

# Add summary
After finishing the analysis, a markdown file can be made to add a summary about the analysis done. Visualizations can also be added to make it a short report.
